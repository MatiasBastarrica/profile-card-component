## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Background images

### What I learned

I learned how to properly use these properties:

- background-image
- background-position
- background-repeat
- background (shorthand property)

### Useful resources

- [background (shorthand)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - This article helped me understand this shorthand property
- [background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand background-position. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
